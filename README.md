### Project Description
A web-based AI legal support assistant that helps women understand their constitutional rights in India. Users can describe their issue in natural language, and the system retrieves relevant Articles from the Constitution of India using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and provides structured legal first-aid guidance.

### The Problem statement
Many women in India are unaware of their legal rights or find it difficult to understand complex legal language. Accessing immediate, reliable legal information during distress is challenging, especially without legal consultation or awareness of constitutional protections.

### The Solution
We built an AI-powered legal assistant using Flask and RAG that analyzes a user’s problem, retrieves relevant Articles from the Constitution of India, and generates a simplified explanation along with suggested next steps and helpline information. The system acts as a first-response legal awareness tool, bridging the gap between complex legal documents and real-world problems.

## Features

**Feature 1:** AI-Powered Legal Understanding
Users can describe their issue in natural language, and the system interprets the meaning using AI.

**Feature 2:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
The system retrieves relevant Articles from the Constitution of India using semantic search before generating responses.

**Feature 3:** Structured Legal First-Aid Response
The output includes:
  Legal summary
  Applicable Articles
  Immediate next steps
  Emergency helpline numbers
  Disclaimer

**Feature 4:** Mini Chatbot Support
Users can ask follow-up questions for better clarification without re-entering the full problem.
